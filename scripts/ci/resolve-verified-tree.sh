# resolve-verified-tree.sh — has a merged pull request already proved this
#                            exact tree green?
# =============================================================================
#
# WHY
# A push to main re-runs the Rust jobs on the commit a
# pull request just produced. When the PR was up to date with main, its squash
# (or merge) commit has byte-for-byte the tree the PR's own CI already built
# and tested, so the push run re-proves a verdict that exists. Most of those
# push runs are also cancelled by the next merge before they finish.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS
# The pushed commit S (first parent P, tree T) is "verified" only when ALL hold
# for some merged pull request associated with S:
#   1. S does not change a rust-cache key input (Cargo.toml / Cargo.lock at any
#      depth, rust-toolchain[.toml], .cargo/). Pushes are the only runs that
#      save the rust-cache; skipping the push that moves the key would leave
#      every later PR restoring a stale cache.
#   2. the PR was merged into the branch that was pushed;
#   3. the PR head H has tree T;
#   4. H contains P (compare P...H is "ahead" or "identical"). A pull_request
#      run tests the merge of H into the base as it was at run time; that base
#      is an ancestor of P, so when H contains P the tested tree IS tree(H) = T.
#      Without this a PR that was not up to date could match T by accident
#      while its CI tested a different merge result;
#   5. on H, the latest GitHub Actions check runs named CI Complete, Check
#      Rust, Backend Unit Tests and Backend Integration Tests all concluded
#      `success`. A `skipped` Rust job (a CI-only PR) proves nothing about
#      Rust, so it does not count.
# The integration check is named on its own because Backend Unit Tests is
# green on a PR whose integration job was skipped by design (no
# backend/tests, backend/migrations or ci.yml change, no `ci:full` label).
# Such a PR proved the unit suites only, so its push runs everything and the
# merged tree gets its integration run there.
#
# MERGE QUEUE: after a queue merge the pushed commit is the merge group's
# head, which is not H and whose parent H usually does not contain, so
# condition 4 refuses and the push re-runs the Rust jobs. That is safe (the
# direction this script fails in), only redundant with the merge-group run;
# looking the checks up on the pushed SHA itself is the follow-up.
#
# FAILS OPEN: any API error, a malformed answer, or no qualifying PR prints
# verified=false and the caller runs the jobs. The script always exits 0 on a
# well-formed invocation; exit 2 is a usage error.
#
# OUTPUT (stdout, one key=value per line; diagnostics go to stderr):
#   verified=true|false
#   reason=<one line>
#
# Usage: resolve-verified-tree.sh <pushed-sha> <pushed-branch>
# Env:   GITHUB_REPOSITORY (owner/repo), GH_TOKEN for gh.
#        CHECK_COMPLETE, CHECK_RUST, CHECK_UNIT, CHECK_INTEGRATION override
#        the check-run names (defaults: the ci.yml job names).
