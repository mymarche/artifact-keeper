# CI gate for issue #1315 (epic #1617 -> #1615 auth consolidation):
# pin the exact set of token-minting endpoints in the API tree.
#
# WHY THIS PIN IS LOAD-BEARING
# ----------------------------
# Every token-minting HTTP handler ultimately calls the single mint
# primitive `AuthService::generate_api_token`. Each such handler must, BEFORE
# minting, refuse to grant admin-class scopes to a non-admin caller -- either
# by routing the requested scopes through
# `token_service::enforce_admin_only_scopes` (self-or-admin endpoints), or by
# gating the whole handler behind `require_admin` (admin-only endpoints).
#
# PRs #1261 and #1306 patched the scope-content policy on each existing
# endpoint individually. The structural risk (issue #1315) is that a 6th
# token-minting endpoint added later silently re-opens the
# privilege-escalation hole because the author forgot the reject rule.
#
# This gate enumerates every PRODUCTION call site of `generate_api_token` in
# `backend/src/api/handlers` (excluding `#[cfg(test)]` modules) and asserts the
# set is EXACTLY the reviewed list below. Adding a new token-minting endpoint
# fails this gate until the author updates `EXPECTED` here -- forcing a
# deliberate, reviewed change. The gate additionally verifies that each owning
# handler file references a reject rule (`enforce_admin_only_scopes` or
# `require_admin`), so a new mint site cannot land without an authz guard.
#
# Mirrors the style of `scripts/ci/check-no-legacy-admin-scope.sh` (#1316) and
# the "Lint migration slots are unique" CI step.
#
# Exits non-zero (failing the build) on any drift.

# THE PINNED SET. Each entry is a production token-minting handler:
#   relative file (under handlers/)  ->  reject rule it MUST enforce.
#
# "scopes"  => the handler funnels requested scopes through
#              token_service::enforce_admin_only_scopes (self-or-admin
#              endpoints: a non-admin may mint a token, but never one bearing
#              an admin-class scope).
# "admin"   => the whole handler is gated by require_admin (admin-only
#              endpoint: only an admin can reach the mint at all).
#
# To add a new token-minting endpoint you MUST add it here in the same PR
# that adds the route -- that is the deliberate, reviewed change #1315 wants.
