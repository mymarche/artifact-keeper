-- Repository visibility axis: public / internal / private.
--
-- Access was previously a single boolean, `repositories.is_public`, giving two
-- states: anonymous-readable, or grant-holders-only. There was no way to say
-- "readable by every authenticated principal, but never anonymously" -- the
-- state most internal repositories on a corporate instance actually need.
--
-- The server-wide guest-access flag (#850) is not a substitute for it: it is
-- all-or-nothing for anonymous callers, and a create/update asking for `public`
-- while it is disabled is refused (#3855; earlier versions silently rewrote it to
-- `private`). An operator who wants "readable by everyone logged in" now declares
-- it on the repository.
--
-- `visibility` is the authoritative field from here on. `is_public` is KEPT as a
-- real column -- not a view and not a generated column, both of which would stop
-- the existing write paths and the out-of-tree Terraform provider from working --
-- and is held equal to `visibility = 'public'` by a trigger added in this same
-- migration.
--
-- Backfill is exactly access-preserving: no repository's read audience changes
-- at upgrade time, and no repository becomes `internal` automatically. Rows that
-- were meant to be internal but were coerced to `is_public = false` by the
-- pre-#3855 guest-access rule are indistinguishable from ordinary private
-- repositories; they are recovered by a documented operator review step, not
-- here.

-- Every statement below is re-run safe: a database that already applied this
-- file under an earlier number (it was 212, 217 and 235 while in review) must
-- be able to apply it again without error and without changing any row.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Keep `is_public` and `visibility` consistent, in the database rather than in
-- application code, so that no write path -- including direct SQL, the older
-- generated SDK, and the out-of-tree Terraform provider -- can bypass it.
--
-- Resolution rules:
--
--   INSERT  If `visibility` was supplied (i.e. is not NULL -- the column has no
--           default, see above), it is authoritative and `is_public` is derived
--           from it; an `is_public = true` contradicting it is REFUSED, not
--           resolved. If it was not supplied, `visibility` is derived from
--           `is_public`, which is the legacy insert path.
--
--   UPDATE  Whichever column's VALUE changed is authoritative. When both
--           values change, `visibility` wins. The trigger compares OLD and NEW
--           and cannot see which columns the statement named in SET, so a
--           `visibility` written equal to its current value does NOT win: an
--           UPDATE that sets `visibility = 'internal', is_public = true` on an
--           internal repository takes the `is_public` branch and lands
--           `public`. The application therefore never writes both columns in
--           one statement (`VisibilityUpdate::binds` in the repositories
--           handler, pinned by a unit test); direct SQL must not either.
--
-- Deriving from the column that CHANGED, rather than from the column's value,
-- is what makes an `internal` repository safe under a legacy full-object write.
-- An `internal` repository already carries `is_public = false`, so a legacy
-- client that rewrites `is_public = false` on every update -- which is what the
-- Terraform provider does, since it declares the field and sends its whole
-- desired state -- produces no column change here, and `visibility` is left
-- alone. Verified idempotent across repeated writes.
--
-- The only path that lands on `private` from a legacy write is a genuine
-- `true -> false` transition, which can only happen on a repository that was
-- `public`. That narrowing is legitimate and is what the legacy field means.
--
-- A value-based rule (`is_public = false` therefore `private`) would instead
-- silently narrow every `internal` repository on each such write, so do not
-- "simplify" this trigger into one.
--
-- The corollary binds the application layer: the repository update path must
-- write `visibility` ONLY when the caller actually supplied it. If it derives
-- and writes `visibility` from a legacy `is_public` field, the first branch
-- below takes over and the protection above is lost.
