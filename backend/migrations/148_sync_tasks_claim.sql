-- Atomic multi-replica claims for sync_tasks (RowClaimedQueue pattern).
--
-- The sync worker used to SELECT pending tasks and only afterwards mark them
-- in_progress with an unconditional UPDATE, so two replicas ticking in the
-- same window could both execute the same peer push/delete. Tasks are now
-- claimed with a FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED CTE that flips pending->in_progress
-- and stamps these columns in the same statement; success/failure updates
-- must present the claim_token.
