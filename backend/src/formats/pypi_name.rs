//! Validated, normalized PyPI project names (PEP 508 + PEP 503).
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! Artifact Keeper carried *two* PyPI name coercions and *zero* validation:
//!
//! * [`crate::api::handlers::pypi::normalize_pep503`] — the policy/gate form.
//!   It DROPS every character outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` without marking a
//!   separator. That drop is a deliberate stored-XSS boundary (#1377) and is
//!   correct as a *sanitizer*.
//! * [`crate::formats::pypi::PypiHandler::normalize_name`] — the fetch/cache-key
//!   form. It maps every non-alphanumeric character to `-`.
//!
//! On any character outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` the two disagree. `acme sdk`
//! becomes `acmesdk` for the gate and `acme-sdk` for the fetch, so a client
//! could clear a curation / dependency-confusion gate under one name and be
//! served a different package's bytes. That divergence has been re-introduced
//! three separate times (#3077, #3179, #3183), each time as a silent security
//! bug rather than a compile error.
//!
//! # The spec position
//!
//! **PEP 503** ("Simple Repository API", *Normalized Names*) defines
//! normalization as exactly:
//!
//! ```text
//! re.sub(r"[-_.]+", "-", name).lower()
//! ```
//!
//! That is the whole rule. It collapses runs of `-`, `_` and `.` into a single
//! `-` and lowercases. It says nothing about any other character — not because
//! other characters are permitted, but because the rule presupposes a name that
//! is already valid.
//!
//! **PEP 508** ("Dependency specification for Python Software Packages",
//! *Names*) supplies that missing precondition:
//!
//! > The format of a name is:
//! >
//! > ```text
//! > ^([A-Z0-9]|[A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9._-]*[A-Z0-9])$
//! > ```
//! >
//! > with `re.IGNORECASE`.
//!
//! So `acme sdk` is not a project name at all, and there is no correct
//! normalization for it — it is outside the input domain of PEP 503's rule.
//! Two coercions disagreeing about an input that has no correct answer is the
//! expected outcome, not an implementation slip.
//!
//! # What this module does
//!
//! [`NormalizedProjectName`] can only be constructed from a name that satisfies
//! the PEP 508 pattern, and it stores the PEP 503 normalized form. Because the
//! fetch and cache-key helpers take `&NormalizedProjectName` rather than
//! `&str`, a raw path segment cannot reach them: a fourth code path that
//! reaches for the wrong coercion now fails to compile instead of shipping a
//! silent gate bypass.
//!
//! # The invariant that makes this a *removal* of the divergence
//!
//! For every PEP 508-valid name, all three functions — PEP 503's reference
//! `re.sub`, `normalize_pep503`, and `PypiHandler::normalize_name` — agree
//! byte for byte. A valid name draws only on `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, so
//! `normalize_pep503` never drops anything, and it begins and ends with an
//! alphanumeric, so neither the leading-separator skip nor the trailing-hyphen
//! pop fires. Validation therefore does not paper over the divergence; it
//! eliminates the inputs on which a divergence can exist. That equivalence is
//! asserted directly in `tests::all_three_normalizers_agree_on_every_valid_name`.
//!
//! This module deliberately does NOT weaken `normalize_pep503`. Its character
//! dropping remains the XSS boundary for names scraped out of upstream HTML,
//! which are not route input and are not validated here.
