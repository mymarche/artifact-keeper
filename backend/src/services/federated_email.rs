//! Synthetic address derivation shared by the federated login paths.
//!
//! `users.email` is `VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL`
//! (`backend/migrations/001_users.sql:8`), but every federated protocol treats
//! the user's address as optional: OIDC releases the `email` claim only when
//! the scope is granted and the IdP chooses to disclose it, and a SAML IdP is
//! free to assert no email attribute at all. Something has to be stored
//! regardless, and whatever is stored has to satisfy the unique index.
//!
//! Each login path grew its own answer to that, which is how the same defect
//! shipped twice: OIDC defaulted every claim-less user to a shared `""`
//! (#3119, fixed in #3161) and SAML defaulted to `{username}@unknown`, built
//! from the *pre-uniquification* username, so two NameIDs whose username
//! attribute matched collided on `users_email_key` (#3167), and LDAP defaulted
//! to `{username}@unknown` in two more places (#3416). This module is the
//! single implementation all of them now call, so a new variant cannot drift.
//!
//! A synthetic address must satisfy four properties. Getting any one wrong
//! reintroduces a bug rather than fixing one:
//!
//! 1. **Unique per identity.** A shared sentinel lets only the first
//!    address-less user provision; every later one dies on `users_email_key`.
//! 2. **Stable across logins.** Re-login writes `email` back to the row. A
//!    value that changes per login (a random nonce, a timestamp) rewrites the
//!    user every time, and on the provisioning path would mint a *new* account
//!    per login — orphaning that user's uploads, quota and permissions. This
//!    is strictly worse than the collision it would "fix".
//! 3. **Keyed on the IdP's subject**, never on a username or display name.
//!    Those are self-settable at many IdPs, so keying on them lets one user
//!    choose a value that collides with another's — turning an availability
//!    defect into a targeted one. The subject is also the value each service
//!    already stores as `users.external_id`, which makes the synthetic address
//!    exactly as unique and exactly as stable as the account row itself.
//! 4. **Non-routable.** `.invalid` is reserved by RFC 2606 and can never
//!    resolve, so a synthetic address can neither be confused with a real
//!    mailbox nor collide against one.
