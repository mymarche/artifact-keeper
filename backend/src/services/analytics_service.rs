    ///    row double count, per-reference multiplication, physical-once
    ///    dedup) lands >= 23 TB outside the window while concurrent tests
    ///    move KBs-to-GBs;
    ///  - the check tolerates +/- `SLACK` (10 GB) of unrelated churn inside
    ///    the observation window and retries a few times.
    /// The repeated upserts themselves are safe: each overwrites today's row
    /// with a fresh cluster-wide aggregate, which is exactly what the daily
