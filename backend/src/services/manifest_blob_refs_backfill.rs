//! One-shot backfill for `manifest_blob_refs` (artifact-keeper#1635).
//!
//! GC prerequisite for #1408 / #1610. The push handler in
//! `api::handlers::oci_v2` populates `manifest_blob_refs` eagerly whenever
//! a regular (non-index) image manifest is committed. That covers every
//! push that lands after the upgrade to a release containing migration
//! 120, but it does not cover image manifests that were pushed before the
//! upgrade and are still reachable: those manifests exist in storage (and
//! are referenced from `oci_tags`) with no corresponding rows in
//! `manifest_blob_refs`.
//!
//! This module walks the image manifests safely backfillable from this
//! repository's own corpus — directly tagged manifests whose content-type is
//! NOT an image index, plus the children of tagged indexes whose manifest body
//! this repository actually holds (#3285) — that
//! have zero `manifest_blob_refs` rows, loads each manifest body from storage,
//! parses the JSON, and inserts the
//! (manifest, blob, repo, kind) edges. The backfill is idempotent
//! (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) and best-effort: a missing storage file or
//! a malformed manifest is logged at WARN and skipped; it does not stop
//! the backfill or fail startup.
//!
//! A *bare* `oci_manifest_refs.child_digest` is intentionally not a backfill
//! source: an index body can reference a digest whose manifest body was never
//! uploaded to this repository. On shared cloud backends, loading that digest
//! from `oci-manifests/<digest>` would import another repository's manifest
//! metadata and later authorize digest fallback through the wrong repository.
//! A child whose manifest body *was* committed into this repository — proven by
//! a live `artifacts` row at `oci-manifests/<child_digest>` under that
//! repository id — carries no such risk and IS backfilled (#3285); see
//! [`LIVE_IMAGE_MANIFEST_SET_SQL`].
//!
//! Called once from `main.rs` after migrations run. On the next restart
//! the same query returns zero rows and the backfill is effectively a
//! no-op SQL query. This reconstructs blob references for the existing
//! corpus so a future blob GC can judge `oci_blobs` orphanhood safely.
//!
//! ADDITIVE ONLY (#1635): this backfill only makes blob references
//! KNOWABLE. It performs no deletion of any kind.
