//! Publisher identity extraction for `publisher_trust` curation rules (#2948).
//!
//! Security model: a publisher identity is only as trustworthy as where it
//! came from. This module makes that provenance explicit:
//!
//! * [`PublisherSource::Attestation`] — the identity comes from a registry
//!   provenance/attestation record (PyPI Trusted Publishers / integrity API
//!   attestation bundles, npm sigstore provenance, conda CEP-27 publish
//!   attestations). When cryptographically verified, these are bound to an
//!   OIDC identity at publish time and are the *strong* trust signal.
//!   Verification of the envelope (sigstore/DSSE/PEP 740, CEP-27) now runs in
//!   `attestation_verify` (#2955, #4048); a verified record reaches this
//!   module through [`VERIFICATION_MARKER`] and yields `verified = true` with
//!   the cert-bound owner. Structural presence of a provenance record is
//!   still not verification, so without that marker extraction always
//!   reports `verified = false` for this source.
//! * [`PublisherSource::Metadata`] — the identity is self-asserted package
//!   metadata (`author`, `maintainer`, `_npmUser`, ...). Anyone can put
//!   "Microsoft" in an `author` field, so this is a *weak*, spoofable signal
//!   (a classic dependency-confusion vector). It is surfaced as a labeled
//!   fallback and must never be treated as equivalent to an attestation.
//!
//! Parsing is deliberately defensive: any missing or malformed field yields
//! `None` rather than a guess, so callers can fail safe.
