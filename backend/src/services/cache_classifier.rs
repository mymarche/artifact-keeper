//! Central proxy-cache correctness classifier (Core Invariant ④, #1611).
//!
//! Cache freshness is a **per-path-pattern property**. Every proxied path is
//! either:
//!
//! * **Immutable** — content-addressed or version-pinned. Once cached it never
//!   changes upstream (a versioned Maven jar, an OCI blob-by-digest, a PyPI
//!   wheel, an npm tarball, a Cargo `.crate`). Immutable entries cache forever
//!   and MUST NEVER contact upstream on a hit.
//! * **Mutable** — an index or pointer that upstream rewrites in place
//!   (`maven-metadata.xml`, the PyPI simple index, an npm packument, an OCI
//!   tag→manifest, the Cargo sparse index). Mutable entries get a short TTL and
//!   conditional revalidation (ETag / `If-None-Match`, `Last-Modified` /
//!   `If-Modified-Since`).
//!
//! ## Why a single central classifier
//!
//! The alternative — a `classify()` method on every format handler — scatters
//! the rules across ~30 handlers and makes the invariant impossible to test as
//! a unit or audit as a whole. One pure module keeps the rules cohesive,
//! table-testable, and free of handler duplication (which also keeps the jscpd
//! gate happy).
//!
//! ## The safe default
//!
//! An UNKNOWN path classifies as [`Mutability::Mutable`] with a conservative
//! TTL. This is the safe direction: misclassifying a *mutable* path as
//! *immutable* serves stale content forever (a silent correctness bug), whereas
//! misclassifying an *immutable* path as *mutable* only costs a cheap
//! conditional revalidation. When in doubt, revalidate.
