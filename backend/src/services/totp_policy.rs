//! System-wide TOTP (2FA) enforcement policy (#2805).
//!
//! TOTP is implemented per user (enrollment, backup codes, login challenge) but
//! has historically been strictly opt-in. This module adds an operator-level
//! policy that can *require* enrollment, plus the lockout-safety rules that make
//! turning it on non-destructive.
//!
//! # Semantics
//!
//! * The policy has three values: [`TotpPolicy::Disabled`] (the default, which
//!   preserves the historical opt-in behaviour), [`TotpPolicy::RequiredForAdmins`]
//!   and [`TotpPolicy::RequiredForAll`].
//! * It is evaluated **only** on the interactive local password login
//!   (`POST /api/v1/auth/login`). API tokens, service accounts, package-client
//!   basic auth, already-issued sessions and the refresh grant are untouched, so
//!   turning the policy on never breaks CI or a running `docker pull`.
//! * SSO/LDAP/CI-authenticated users are exempt: their MFA is delegated to the
//!   identity provider, and Artifact Keeper holds no password for them.
//! * A subject user who has not enrolled is **not rejected**. Instead of a
//!   session, the login returns a short-lived *enrollment ticket* which
//!   authorizes exactly two calls — `/auth/totp/enroll/setup` and
//!   `/auth/totp/enroll/complete` — and the completing call issues the real
//!   session. The grace is "finish enrolling inside this login", never a
//!   countdown of days, so there is no moment at which a valid password stops
//!   yielding a way in.
//!
//! # Lockout safety
//!
//! Two independent guards, because "the operator cannot lock every admin out of
//! their own instance" has to hold even when the *client* is at fault:
//!
//! 1. [`check_policy_activation`] refuses to turn enforcement on unless the
//!    admin making the change already has TOTP enabled. That admin's login path
//!    (password + `/auth/totp/verify`) is the pre-existing, already-working one,
//!    so at least one administrator provably retains access no matter how the
//!    new enrollment exchange is handled by whatever UI is deployed.
//! 2. The `TOTP_POLICY` environment variable pins the effective policy and wins
//!    over the stored setting, so `TOTP_POLICY=disabled` plus a restart is an
//!    offline break-glass that needs no working login at all.
//!
//! Relaxing the policy (towards [`TotpPolicy::Disabled`], or from
//! `required_for_all` to `required_for_admins`) is never blocked: a guard that
//! can trap an operator in the strict state would defeat the point.
