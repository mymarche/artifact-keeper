//! Digest-keyed proxy scan verdict store (#2954).

//! Proxy-cached bytes are deliberately NOT written to `artifacts` (#1278/#1280),

//!
//!   * a repeat pull of a known-vulnerable digest is blocked WITHOUT re-fetching

//!   * a verdict is shared across repos/tenants pulling identical bytes (same
//!     bytes = same CVEs) and survives proxy-cache eviction.
//!
//! The freshness and fail-open/closed decision logic lives in pure functions so
