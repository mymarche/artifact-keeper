//! Persisted proxy-cache catalog CRUD (#2218 accounting, #2270 visibility /
//! download counting).
//!
//! Proxy-cached objects deliberately carry NO `artifacts` row (#1280, which
//! fixed the #1278 doubled-prefix 500 on the filesystem backend). That left the
//! DB blind to proxy-cached bytes, so storage accounting, cache listing, and
//! download counting could not see them. This module owns the SEPARATE
//! `proxy_cache_artifacts` catalog table (migration 159) plus the sibling
//! `proxy_download_statistics` table (migration 160): a queryable index the
//! format-handler serve path never reads, so it cannot re-open #1278.
//!
//! The catalog row is upserted at sidecar-commit time inside
//! [`crate::services::proxy_service::CachePersister`] with the TRUE written
//! byte count + checksum, deleted on cache invalidation, and self-heals for
//! pre-existing objects via a best-effort lazy backfill on cache hit. The SQL
//! lives here (rather than inline in `proxy_service.rs`) so the near-duplicate
//! query bodies stay out of the jscpd Rust-duplication window and the write
//! path stays small.

// files, in the same table and with the same shape:
//
//     simple/idna/                           text/html              26281
//     simple/idna/idna-3.18-py3-none-any.whl binary/octet-stream    65455
//
// The `simple/<pkg>/` row is a cached HTML index page, not an artifact. Left
// unfiltered it renders in the artifact listing with an EMPTY name column, and
// -- worse -- it counts as an unscanned item in the proxy scan summary, where
// it is a permanent false positive: an HTML index has no package inventory, so
// no scan can ever clear it and the operator is shown an "unknown" status with
// no available remedy.
//
// These rows are NOT deleted and caching them is not changed: they are real
// cache entries occupying real bytes, so storage accounting
// ([`sum_by_repo`] and the repository usage rollups) deliberately still counts
// them. Only their PRESENTATION as artifacts and their inclusion in scan counts
// is wrong.
//
// CONSEQUENCE, and it is the correct trade: a repository's storage total no
// longer reconciles with the sum of its listed artifacts' sizes. The listing
// answers "what packages are cached here", storage answers "what bytes are on
// disk", and index responses are bytes that are not packages. Any future
// reconciliation check between the two must account for index rows rather than
// "fixing" this filter.
//
// The definition lives HERE, once, and is consumed by both the artifact listing
// ([`browse_page`] / [`browse_count`]) and every proxy-scan query in
// `api::handlers::security`. Two copies would drift and the two views would
// disagree again, which is the bug this exists to prevent --
// `cached_index_sql_and_rust_agree` pins the SQL and Rust forms to each other.

/// To make the first serve count, this ensures a catalog row for

/// `checksum NULL`) the tee later refines IN PLACE with the true size/checksum
/// via its own `ON CONFLICT (repository_id, path) DO UPDATE` upsert — and

/// records — so exactly one `proxy_download_statistics` row is written per
/// serve, with no double count and the proxy sibling kept fully separate from
/// the hot `download_statistics` table.
