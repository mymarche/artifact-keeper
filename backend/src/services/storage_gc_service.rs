    ///   `UPDATE` blocks on that lock, and when it is released the row is
    ///   gone — zero rows affected, `false`, and the caller skips the storage

/// registered* is distinguishable from there never having been one.
///
/// # Why the push has to participate
///
/// The cleanup sweep destroys `oci-blobs/<digest>` objects it believes nothing
/// references. Its liveness predicate is `NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM oci_blobs
/// ...)`, and a re-push of a swept digest **INSERTs a new** `oci_blobs` row —
/// there is no existing row for the sweep to have locked, so no amount of
/// `FOR UPDATE` on `oci_blobs` (the mechanism that protects the blob GC one
/// layer down, via [`is_blob_still_orphan`]) can serialize the two. The
/// journal row is the only object both sides touch, and this function is what
/// makes the push touch it under a lock.
///
/// # The protocol
///
/// 1. `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` the journal row. This blocks against a sweep's
///    in-flight phase-1 tombstone `UPDATE`, and makes a sweep's phase-1
///    `UPDATE` block against us. That mutual exclusion is the whole guarantee;
///    everything below is just deciding who won.
/// 2. **Row present, tombstoned, claim still live** → [`Doomed`]. The sweep
///    committed its intent before we took the lock, so its `storage.delete()`
///    is already in flight or done. Committing an `oci_blobs` row here is
///    exactly the #3085 data loss.
/// 3. **Row present, no tombstone (or a lapsed claim)** → delete it under the
///    lock and return [`Cleared`]. A sweep's phase-1 `UPDATE` now finds no row,
///    so it never deletes the object. A tombstone whose `claim_expires_at` has
///    passed belongs to a crashed sweep and is not binding — otherwise a crash
///    would doom that digest permanently.
/// 4. **Row absent** → the push registered a row and something removed it.
///    Three causes, and they must not be conflated:
///    * A **concurrent push of the same key** won and cleared the row in the
///      same transaction that committed its own `oci_blobs` row. An
///      `oci_blobs` row referencing this key proves it: the peer's journal
///      delete and its INSERT commit together, so we cannot observe one
///      without the other. The bytes are live → [`Cleared`].
///    * The **repository was deleted**, cascading the journal row away
///      (`oci_upload_cleanup_keys.repository_id ... ON DELETE CASCADE`). No
///      sweep is involved and there is nothing to protect; return [`Cleared`]
///      so the caller's own `oci_blobs` INSERT fails on its foreign key and
///      reports *that*, rather than this function inventing a concurrent-GC
///      diagnosis for an unrelated failure.
///    * Otherwise a **sweep reaped it**. Phase 3 only removes a row whose
///      object it just deleted, so the bytes are gone → [`Doomed`].
