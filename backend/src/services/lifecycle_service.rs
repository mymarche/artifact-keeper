//! Lifecycle policy service.
//!
//! Manages artifact retention policies per repository with support for:
//! - max_age_days: delete artifacts older than N days
//! - max_versions: keep only the last N versions per package
//! - no_downloads_days: delete artifacts not downloaded in N days
//! - tag_pattern_keep: delete artifacts whose name does NOT match a regex
//!   pattern (the SQL inverse of `tag_pattern_delete`). Despite the "keep"
//!   name this is a *deletion* policy, NOT a protection rule: it does not
//!   mark matching artifacts as protected and does not stop other lifecycle
//!   policies from deleting artifacts it preserved. Each policy emits an
//!   independent `UPDATE artifacts SET is_deleted = true` with no shared
//!   notion of "protected", so pairing `tag_pattern_keep` with a
//!   `tag_pattern_delete` (or any other deletion policy) on the same
//!   repository can still empty the repository. The wire string stays
//!   `tag_pattern_keep` for backward compatibility. See issue #1905.
//! - tag_pattern_delete: delete artifacts matching a regex pattern
//! - size_quota_bytes: enforce per-repo storage quotas
//!
//! Every policy type additionally accepts an optional `config.exclude` block
//! naming artifacts the sweep must never delete (#2024):
//!
//! ```json
//! { "days": 14, "exclude": { "versions": ["latest", "stable"],
//!                            "version_patterns": ["^v[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+$"] } }
//! ```
//!
//! Unlike `tag_pattern_keep` -- which is a deletion pass in disguise, see
//! above -- an exclusion is a genuine protection rule *within its policy*: it
//! is compiled into the WHERE clause of both the candidate query and the
//! soft-delete, so an excluded artifact is never selected in the first place.
//! It is still per-policy, not a global keep-list: a second policy without the
//! same `exclude` block can still delete the artifact.
//!
//! Unknown keys in `config` are rejected at create/update time rather than
//! ignored, so a misspelt exclusion fails loudly instead of deleting what it
//! was written to protect.

/// * anything whose suffix is not a valid tag — the tag regex excludes `/`, so

///
/// **Formats.** All six formats that `formats::handler_for` routes to the OCI
/// handler share this naming, not just `docker`; gating on `docker` alone left
/// #2998 open for podman, buildx, oras, wasm_oci and helm_oci. (`"oci"` is a
/// parser alias, not a `repository_format` enum value, so it is not listed.)
///
/// **Recency.** Ordering is `COALESCE(oci_tags.updated_at, created_at)`, not
/// `created_at`. A manifest PUT upserts the existing `artifacts` row and never
/// touches `created_at`, so a rolling tag is always the OLDEST row of its image
/// and would be evicted first no matter how recently it was pushed. `a.id`

/// before further pool work, on a 6-hour cron -- and the global variant has no
/// repository scope at all.
///
/// At most one tag row can match, so the join cannot duplicate artifact rows:

///    is not soft-deleted under the same join shape). The inner
///    `NOT EXISTS` must be self-aware so two doomed tags for one digest
///    cannot each treat the other as a protector; or
/// 2. **no live `artifacts` row backs the digest** in this repository
///    (#3732). Then nothing the sweep left behind still claims the image:
///    every artifact for the digest is soft-deleted, the manifest is
///    exactly as unreachable as after an explicit
///    `DELETE /v2/<image>/manifests/<tag>`, and retaining the tag would
///    only keep storage GC and blob GC from ever reclaiming it. "Backs the
///    digest" is keyed on `'sha256:' || checksum_sha256` (as the startup
///    OCI reindex's orphan-tag reconciliation in `oci_migration_reindex.rs`
///    is) OR on the canonical `oci-manifests/<digest>` storage key: a
///    pre-#2457 migrated manifest keeps its live row at a generic CAS key,
///    and the tag of a live image must never be pruned because of where
///    its bytes sit. The prong also requires `ot.updated_at <=

///    `handle_put_manifest` commits its `oci_tags` upsert before it
///    revives the `artifacts` row, so a tag newer than the tombstone is a
///    re-push in flight (this cascade runs in a later READ COMMITTED
///    transaction and may not see the live row yet) and is left alone.
///
/// Prong 2 is what keeps #1682's own acceptance criterion — the single-tag
/// image stays reclaimable once its last legitimate reference is gone —
/// while prong 1 still protects a digest that a sibling tag not matched by
/// this sweep continues to hold. A digest still backed by a live artifact
/// (a digest-pinned push, a tag the sweep did not match) keeps its tags
