//! Upstream change-feed subscriptions for proxy repositories (#2249).
//!
//! A proxy can only bound metadata staleness with TTLs unless the upstream
//! says when packages change. Some upstreams do: npm publishes a public
//! replication feed (`replicate.npmjs.com/_changes`) streaming package-change
//! events. That endpoint answers to a CouchDB-*shaped* `_changes` document but
//! is not CouchDB — it self-identifies as `engine: npm-replicate` and rejects
//! the CouchDB long-poll controls (`feed=`, `timeout=`, `since=now`) with 400.
//! It supports only a plain numeric `since` cursor plus `limit`. This module is
//! a small, generic subscription framework over such feeds:
//!
//! * [`UpstreamFeedAdapter`] — per-ecosystem driver turning one upstream feed
//!   into a normalised stream of [`FeedEvent`]s. First implementation:
//!   [`NpmReplicationFeedAdapter`], which polls `_changes?since=<n>&limit=<n>`,
//!   resuming from the last sequence number and bootstrapping the head cursor
//!   from the feed root's `update_seq` on first enablement.
//! * [`FeedAction`] — pluggable per-event action. Default:
//!   [`PackumentInvalidationAction`], which drops the cached computed
//!   packuments for the changed package in every remote npm repository
//!   proxying the feed's upstream (and every virtual repo containing one).
//! * [`FeedConsumer`] — the runner: cluster-wide single consumer via the
//!   existing advisory-lock primitive (so N replicas do not open N feed
//!   connections), resume cursor persisted in `upstream_feed_state`
//!   (migration 156), reconnect with capped exponential backoff.
//!
//! Best-effort by design: the feed is a freshness optimisation, never the
//! correctness mechanism — the packument cache's TTL/stale-while-revalidate
//! windows remain the staleness floor if the feed is down, re-shaped, or
//! events are missed. Actions must therefore be idempotent; a dual-consumer
//! overlap after a leader's lock connection silently dies is harmless and
//! bounded by the leadership term (leaders step down and re-contend).
//!
//! Cross-replica note: with the shared (Redis) packument-cache backend an
//! invalidation issued by the consumer propagates to every replica; with the
//! in-process backend it clears the consumer's replica only and the other
//! replicas fall back to the TTL floor.
