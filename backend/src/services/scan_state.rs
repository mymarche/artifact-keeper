//! Shared scan-state classification for promotion gating.
//!
//! Both promotion paths must agree on whether an artifact is "scanned" before
//! it may be promoted:
//!
//! * the **manual / policy** path ([`super::promotion_policy_service`]) enforces
//!   the `block_unscanned` gate (#1643), and
//! * the **auto-promotion / rule** path ([`super::promotion_rule_service`])
//!   evaluates `max_cve_severity` rules.
//!
//! Previously each path classified scan state on its own, and the rule path
//! failed open: a `max_cve_severity` rule with no completed scan skipped the CVE
//! check and auto-promoted the artifact. Hoisting the classifier here lets both
//! paths share one table-tested definition of "unscanned" and deny by default.
