//! Webhook producer service.
//!
//! Subscribes to the EventBus and writes a row into `webhook_deliveries` for
//! every webhook whose `events` array contains the mapped event type and whose
//! `repository_id` matches (or is NULL, meaning "global"). The row is enqueued
//! with `next_retry_at = NOW()`, `attempts = 0`, `success = false`. The retry
//! scheduler in `crate::api::handlers::webhooks::process_webhook_retries`
//! (driven from `scheduler_service`) picks rows up on its 30-second tick and
//! performs the actual HTTP POST.
//!
//! This module is the missing producer in v1.1.9. Before it existed, the
//! retry scheduler had nothing to retry: no code path inserted into
//! `webhook_deliveries`. The result was that webhook delivery was dead code.
//!
//! Companion ticket E2 (HMAC signing) and E4 (richer payload schema) are
//! independent and can land before or after this PR. This module emits a
//! minimal v1 payload. HMAC signing happens at delivery time, not enqueue
//! time, so it is the retry scheduler's responsibility, not this producer's.
