//! Auto-disable for dead-lettered webhooks.
//!
//! When the retry loop exhausts a delivery's retry budget, the webhook
//! is auto-disabled with `disabled_reason` set so operators can see
//! WHY their webhook stopped firing. Emits a structured tracing warn
//! that is paired with the `ak_webhook_dead_letter_total{event}`
//! counter to give ops visibility without depending on an in-app
//! notifications table (none exists in this codebase today).
//!
//! Idempotent: if the webhook is already disabled the row update is a
//! no-op (matched by the `is_enabled = true` predicate) and the warn
//! is still emitted so operators see every dead-letter on the wire.
