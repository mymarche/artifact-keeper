//! Repository attribution for row-less Maven flat-key objects (#2574, #2584).
//!
//! On shared cloud namespaces (S3/GCS/Azure) every repository's Maven objects
//! live under the same bare `maven/{path}` key space -- the per-repository
//! `storage_path` prefix that isolates filesystem backends is not applied. A
//! *row-less* object (a GAV-grouped companion file, a verbatim
//! `maven-metadata.xml`, or a stored checksum sidecar) carries no inherent
//! repository attribution, so a naive "is there a foreign row?" check treats it
//! as unowned for *every* repository and re-opens the cross-tenant hole #2504
//! closed.
//!
//! This module resolves the single owning repository of a flat key from the
//! catalog (live artifact rows, the `maven_flat_object_owner` attribution
//! table backfilled by migration 163 and qualified by storage backend in
//! migration 168, and parent-artifact metadata `files[]`), and uses that to:
//!
//! * gate reads -- serve a legacy flat object only to its genuine owner
//!   ([`flat_key_readable`]); and
//! * gate writes -- refuse a cross-repository overwrite before the write
//!   ([`guard_flat_key_writable`], a read-only check), then commit a
//!   first-writer-wins attribution claim only after the object bytes are
//!   successfully written ([`claim_flat_key_on_write`]). Splitting the check
//!   from the claim keeps an aborted or coordinate-invalid write from flipping
//!   ownership of a foreign unattributed key (#2584, V3b).
//!
//! Filesystem backends physically isolate each repository's key space, so every
//! entry point short-circuits to the pre-existing behavior there and never
//! consults the catalog.

/// * `\` is Postgres's DEFAULT `LIKE` escape character, and it does the

///   `maven/ab/`: the rollup's own live artifact at `maven/a\b/1.0/x.jar`

///   without the clause and TRUE with `ESCAPE ''`.

/// So the pre-`ESCAPE` comment here — "can only ever over-PROTECT" — was true
/// of `%`/`_` and false of `\`, and a Maven upload can put a literal backslash
