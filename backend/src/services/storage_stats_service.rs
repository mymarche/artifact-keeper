//! Deduplicated storage accounting service (epic #2056, P1).
//!
//! Computes the true *physical* storage footprint per repository across the
//! three physical sources — `artifacts` (CAS / coordinate / OCI manifests),
//! `oci_blobs` (OCI layers, previously omitted from all accounting), and the
//! `proxy_cache_artifacts` catalog — and materialises the result into
//! `repository_storage_stats` + `instance_storage_stats` so the API can read
//! it in O(1).
//!
//! This is a **parallel, read-only** accounting layer. It does NOT feed quota
//! enforcement: `RepositoryService::check_quota` continues to read the live
//! logical `SUM` (see #2056 §7). Repointing quota at the deduplicated number
//! would loosen effective limits and is a deliberate non-change here.
//!
//! # Dedup model
//!
//! Every physical object is identified by a *dedup key* (its storage
//! key / digest). The three sources are normalised into one
//! `(repository_id, dedup_key, size_bytes)` relation ([`REPO_OBJECT_UNION_SQL`]),
//! then a single aggregate pass yields, per `(repository_id, dedup_key)`, the
//! object size, the in-repo reference count (the logical multiplier), and the
//! global count of distinct repositories referencing the key. The pure
//! [`compute_stats`] function turns those rows into per-repo figures, branching
//! on the backend-aware [`DedupScope`]:
//!
//! * `filesystem` (`DedupScope::PerRepo`): a digest present in two repos is two
//!   physical files, so `shared_bytes` is always 0 and the instance total is
//!   the sum over every `(repo, key)`.
//! * cloud `s3`/`gcs`/`azure` (`DedupScope::Instance`): one physical object
//!   backs a digest across all repos, so a key seen in >1 repo is `shared`, and
//!   the instance total counts each global key once.
