//! Negative-result cache for the npm attestation meta endpoint (#3764).
//!
//! `npm audit signatures` (and `npm install` with
//! `--foreground-scripts`/provenance checks) asks the registry for a
//! provenance attestation bundle per resolved package version:
//!
//! ```text
//! GET /npm/{repo}/-/npm/v1/attestations/{package}@{version}
//! ```
//!
//! The overwhelming majority of published npm versions have no provenance
//! attestation, so the registry answers `404` for almost every one of these.
//! Artifact Keeper relays that answer correctly — for Remote and Virtual
//! repositories the whole `/-/` meta namespace is proxied through
//! [`crate::api::handlers::npm`] and the upstream status is returned verbatim
//! — but it relayed it *without memoising anything*. Every repeat of the same
//! `pkg@version` question paid a fresh upstream round trip, a request slot
//! against the global concurrency cap, and the repo-resolve + permission
//! queries in front of it.
//!
//! That repeat rate is the whole problem: a CI fleet re-resolves the same
//! dependency graph continuously, so the distinct-URI count is one to two
//! orders of magnitude below the request count. A day of one mid-size
//! deployment's traffic showed ~3.4k distinct attestation URIs across ~231k
//! requests — ~67 identical questions per URI per day, every one of them
//! forwarded to the upstream registry.
//!
//! This cache stores those answers so the repeats never leave the process.
//!
//! Scope — deliberately narrow, because the `/-/` namespace as a whole is
//! **not** cacheable:
//!
//! * **Only `/-/npm/v1/attestations/*`.** `/-/whoami` is per-principal,
//!   `/-/v1/search` is query-dependent, `/-/npm/v1/user` is per-token.
//!   Caching the meta namespace wholesale would be a security bug, so the
//!   gate ([`attestation_spec`]) is a prefix match on exactly one endpoint.
//! * **Only negative answers** (`404`, `410`). npm forbids republishing a
//!   version, so "this version has no attestation" is effectively stable;
//!   `200` bodies are real provenance documents and are never cached, so a
//!   newly-published attestation is visible immediately. Authentication
//!   failures (`401`/`403`), rate limits and 5xx are transient and never
//!   cached either.
//! * **Only when the repository's npm scope policy is inactive.** An active
//!   policy rewrites meta bodies per repository
//!   (`filter_meta_response`), so a cached body would have to carry the
//!   policy's identity to stay correct. Skipping the cache there keeps the
//!   filtering path byte-for-byte unchanged.
//! * **Only for query-less requests.** An attestation request carries no
//!   query string; anything that does is a different question and is passed
//!   straight through.
//!
//! Key: `(member_repo_id, upstream_url, meta_path)`. The **answering member**
//! repository is the identity, not the repository named in the URL: a Virtual
//! repo resolves `/-/*` against the members *this caller is authorized to
//! read* (`authorized_virtual_members`), so keying on the virtual repo would
//! let one tenant's request be answered from an upstream response fetched for
//! a member they cannot reach. Keying on the member that actually answered
//! means the authorization walk still runs on every request and can only
//! reach entries for members the caller may use — while two virtual repos
//! sharing a member correctly share one cache entry. The upstream URL is
//! folded in so repointing a repository's upstream cannot be answered from
//! the previous upstream's entry.
//!
//! Bounds: entries expire at the TTL and the map is capped by entry count
//! (oldest-stored first eviction) with a per-body byte cap, so neither a
//! large dependency graph nor a hostile upstream error page can grow it
//! without limit. The cache is in-process and per-replica; there is no
//! cross-replica coordination to get wrong because there is nothing to
//! invalidate — entries are immutable facts that simply age out.
