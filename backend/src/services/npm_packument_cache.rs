//! Computed-packument response cache with stale-while-revalidate for the npm
//! metadata path (#2162).
//!
//! Every npm packument request against a remote or virtual repository pays an
//! upstream round-trip plus the full transform pipeline (parse, rewrite
//! `dist.tarball` URLs, abbreviate, serialize, compress). This module caches
//! the *final response bytes* (identity and gzip variants) so a warm hit
//! serves pre-encoded bytes with no upstream fetch and no recompute — the
//! computed analogue of the cargo `IndexCache` / APT `SignedReleaseCache`.
//!
//! Scope: the handler only engages this cache for **remote and virtual**
//! repositories, where the cost being removed is the upstream round-trip.
//! Local (hosted) packuments are a cheap indexed DB read, and caching them
//! would break read-your-writes across replicas with the in-process backend
//! (a publish on pod A would leave pod B serving the pre-publish entry as
//! fresh for the whole fresh window).
//!
//! Freshness model (stale-while-revalidate):
//! * age < fresh TTL — served directly.
//! * fresh TTL <= age < stale max — served immediately while a background
//!   task refreshes the entry; a per-key claim keeps a burst of stale hits
//!   from spawning more than one refresh.
//! * age >= stale max — the entry is gone (backends expire it) and the
//!   request recomputes inline, deduplicated through the same buffered
//!   single-flight primitive the proxy hydration path uses.
//!
//! Backends: the in-process map (default) or, when
//! `NPM_PACKUMENT_CACHE_REDIS_URL` is configured, a layered backend that
//! reads Redis first (shared across replicas) and falls back to an
//! always-warm in-process layer whenever Redis errors. Every operation
//! retries Redis, so recovery is automatic once it returns; a cache outage
//! never fails a request. Redis invalidation is driven by a per-package key
//! index (a small `SET` maintained on write), so it never scans the keyspace.
//!
//! Write-after-invalidate: stores run under a [`StoreGuard`] carrying a
//! per-package generation captured before the compute starts; an invalidation
//! bumps the generation, so a compute that raced a local write cannot
//! re-install pre-write data (checked before AND after the backend write).
//! The guard is process-local: a compute on replica A racing an invalidation
//! issued on replica B can still land pre-write data in Redis. That window is
//! bounded — the entry ages out of the fresh window after the fresh TTL and a
//! background refresh then replaces it — and is inherent to any shared cache
//! without a coordination primitive; a Redis-side tombstone is the known
//! follow-up if the bounded window ever matters in practice.
