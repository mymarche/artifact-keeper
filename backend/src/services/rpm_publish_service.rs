//! Curated RPM snapshot publish (#2358 — RPM curation Phase-3).
//!
//! Freezes the *approved* subset of a curation repo's synced packages into a
//! monotonic, immutable `repository_version`, then publishes it as signed,
//! AK-generated repodata that is served under `/rpm/{key}/@N/`.
//!
//! Two steps:
//!   1. [`create_version`] snapshots `curation_packages WHERE status = 'approved'`
//!      into a new `repository_versions` row (version N = MAX + 1, allocated in a
//!      single serializable transaction so the number is monotonic under
//!      concurrency) plus its `repository_version_packages` membership. It fails
//!      closed on an empty approved set and on any approved package missing its
//!      structured `primary_metadata` (which means it must be re-synced).
//!   2. [`publish`] CANONICALLY re-serializes `primary.xml` from each member's
//!      validated `primary_metadata` struct — every text node and attribute is
//!      escaped and every `<location>` is rebuilt from validated NEVRA, so
//!      attacker-influenced upstream content can never be signed verbatim. It
//!      then generates pkgid-consistent stub `filelists.xml`/`other.xml` via the
//!      existing hosted RPM generators, builds and SIGNS a
//!      `repomd.xml`, and stores every blob (including the detached signature and
//!      the public key *as they were at publish time*) beneath the version's
//!      `storage_prefix`. Serving `@N` then reads these frozen blobs, so a later
//!      signing-key rotation never retroactively invalidates a published `@N`.
