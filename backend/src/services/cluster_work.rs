//! Cluster-wide background-work claim primitives.
//!
//! Multiple backend replicas share one Postgres database. Any background job
//! that (a) selects work because it is due/pending/stale and (b) performs a
//! non-idempotent side effect (peer HTTP, SMTP, storage delete, archive write)
//! must claim that work durably in Postgres *before* the side effect, or every
//! replica performs it once per tick.
//!
//! This module holds the shared vocabulary for those claims:
//!
//! * [`WorkerIdentity`] — stable per-process owner id, for diagnostics.
//! * [`Claimed<T>`] — a row payload plus proof of ownership (`claim_token`).
//!   Side-effecting workers should accept `Claimed<Row>`, not a bare id, so
//!   an unclaimed call site does not typecheck.
//! * [`SchedulerLease`] / [`try_acquire_scheduler_lease`] — a durable lease
//!   for singleton periodic jobs, backed by the `scheduler_leases` table
//!   (migration 147).
//!
//! Coordination patterns (declare one when adding recurring work):
//!
//! | Pattern            | Use for                                            |
//! |--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
//! | `RowClaimedQueue`  | Independent rows drained concurrently across replicas (claim CTE with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`). |
//! | `SingletonLease`   | Exactly one replica runs a coarse periodic job ([`try_acquire_scheduler_lease`]). |
//! | `DueRun`           | A schedule produces one durable run per due time (unique `(schedule_id, scheduled_for)` row). |
//! | `StateMachineLease`| A request/finalizer owns a row through states (`state` + `state_token`, like OCI upload completion). |
//! | `IdempotentDbOnly` | Duplicate execution is acceptable; side effects are DB-only/idempotent. |
//!
//! Row-level claim SQL stays per-table (typed, reviewable) rather than
//! string-built here; see `sync_worker::claim_pending_sync_tasks` for the
//! reference `RowClaimedQueue` implementation. The random `claim_token` is
//! the correctness guard everywhere; `owner_id`/`claimed_by` is diagnostic.
//!
//! The cross-replica *advisory lock* seam (in-flight, auto-released on
//! connection death, no durable state) lives in
//! [`crate::services::cluster_lock`]; leases here are durable and survive the
//! claiming process, which is what queue-like retryable work needs.
