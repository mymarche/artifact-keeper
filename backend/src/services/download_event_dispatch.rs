//! Bounded dispatch for download-path side-effect writes (#2522).
//!
//! The download hot path emits two best-effort telemetry writes per served
//! body: a `download_statistics` row ([`record_download`]) and an
//! `ARTIFACT_DOWNLOADED` audit row (the `finish_download` epilogue). #2522
//! first moved both OFF the byte plane via `tokio::spawn`, which fixed the
//! latency coupling but left the *bounded* half of the issue open: every
//! request spawned a detached task that grabbed a catalog-pool connection with
//! no cap and no backpressure. Under a download flood with a slow or failing
//! event store, detached tasks and pool waiters grow without bound — memory +
//! connection exhaustion that couples back into serving (artifact lookup needs
//! the same pool).
//!
//! This module replaces the per-request spawns with the codebase's established
//! bounded-outbox shape:
//!
//! * one process-global **bounded** `mpsc` channel behind an
//!   `OnceLock<Option<Sender>>` — the same install/degrade idiom as
//!   `GLOBAL_AUTH_SEMAPHORE` (`auth_service.rs`): tests or embedders that never
//!   install a dispatcher get a graceful no-op, never a panic;
//! * a **fixed** pool of background flush workers (modelled on
//!   `webhook_producer::start_webhook_producer`) that drain the channel and
//!   **batch-INSERT** into the existing `download_statistics` / `audit_log`
//!   tables — fewer round-trips than the historical one-INSERT-per-request;
//! * producers only ever [`try_enqueue`] (a synchronous `try_send`): a full
//!   queue **sheds** the event (drop + `ak_download_events_dropped_total`
//!   metric) instead of blocking or growing. The byte plane is never touched.
//!
//! These events are best-effort analytics/trail writes (see
//! `audit_fire_and_forget`: "a side effect, never a gate") — loss on overflow
//! or crash is the pre-existing contract, not a regression. Strict crash
//! durability would be a separate durable-outbox slice.
//!
