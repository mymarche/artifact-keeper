//! Per-deployment scoping of the proxy-cache key space (#3454).
//!
//! # The problem
//!
//! Proxy-cache content is anchored at the storage **root**, never under
//! `S3_PREFIX` (see [`crate::storage::BUCKET_ROOT_KEY_NAMESPACES`] and #3368).
//! That is deliberate — it is what makes a prefixed deployment read back the
//! objects it wrote — but it also meant the whole namespace was
//! `proxy-cache/<repo_key>/<path>/__content__`, with nothing in it naming the
//! deployment that produced it.
//!
//! Two Artifact Keeper deployments pointed at the same bucket and separated
//! only by `S3_PREFIX` therefore shared ONE proxy-cache key space. Two
//! repositories that happen to carry the same key — `maven-proxy`,
//! `npm-remote`, whatever the operator called it — addressed the same physical
//! object in both deployments. Each one served the other's cached upstream
//! bytes: content it never fetched, from an upstream it is not configured to
//! use, possibly retrieved with the other deployment's upstream credentials.
//! The last writer won, so it is a two-way exchange, not a leak in one
//! direction.
//!
//! # The scope
//!
//! A [`ProxyCacheScope`] inserts one segment immediately after the reserved
//! `proxy-cache/` namespace:
//!
//! ```text
//! proxy-cache/<scope>/<repo_key>/<path>/__content__
//! ```
//!
//! Placing the segment INSIDE the reserved namespace rather than moving the
//! namespace under `S3_PREFIX` is what keeps the blast radius small:
//!
//! * `key_is_bucket_root_anchored` still returns true, so the S3 and
//!   filesystem backends still resolve the key at the shared root and #3368
//!   stays fixed.
//! * `ProxyService::is_proxy_cache_key` and every `storage_key NOT LIKE
//!   'proxy-cache/%'` predicate in the accounting SQL still match, so storage
//!   analytics, the usage ledger and the quota admission path are unchanged.
//! * The IAM `Resource` list operators were told to grant in `.env.example`
//!   (`arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>/proxy-cache/*`) still covers the new keys, so no
//!   policy has to be re-cut.
//! * The `proxy-cache-staging/` namespace is left unscoped: its keys are
//!   freshly minted v4 UUIDs that cannot collide across deployments, and
//!   leaving it alone keeps the single documented lifecycle rule valid.
//!
//! # Choosing the identifier
//!
//! The scope is the deployment's persistent **peer instance id** — the UUID in
//! the `peer_instance_identity` table that `init_peer_identity` seeds on first
//! boot and never rewrites. It is the right identifier for a cache scope for
//! three reasons:
//!
//! * **Stable.** It is written once and only read afterwards; restarts,
//!   upgrades, rescheduling and replica count do not change it. Every replica
//!   of one deployment reads the same row, so a horizontally-scaled deployment
//!   shares one cache — which is the whole point of having one.
//! * **Immune to unrelated config edits.** `PEER_INSTANCE_NAME` and
//!   `PEER_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` are reconciled into that row on every boot, but the
//!   id is not. Keying the cache on a mutable setting would silently orphan the
//!   entire cache the first time an operator renamed something.
//! * **Unique per deployment.** It is a v4 UUID minted against the
//!   deployment's own database, and two deployments sharing a bucket by
//!   definition have separate databases.
//!
//! An operator who wants a legible or pinned value can override it with
//! `PROXY_CACHE_SCOPE`; see [`ProxyCacheScope::from_env_and_identity`]. There
//! is deliberately no value that turns scoping off.
