/// implementation that hosts the existing buffered single-flight behavior
/// ([`coordinate_proxy_hydration`]) unchanged. Two further layers are designed
/// to plug in here *without reshaping this method*:
///
/// * **Layer 2 — streaming broadcast fan-out (#1631 / #895).** The streaming
///   proxy path ([`ProxyService::fetch_artifact_streaming`]) has a
///   fundamentally different follower semantic: followers cannot re-check the
///   cache mid-flight because the body is not cached until the tee completes,
///   so they must SUBSCRIBE to the leader's chunks (a `tokio::sync::broadcast`
///   fan-out) instead of waiting-then-rechecking. That is a *different
///   primitive*, not a tweak of [`Self::coordinate`]: it will be added as a
///   SEPARATE method on this trait (e.g. `coordinate_stream`) or a sibling
///   trait, never by forcing a stream through the buffered method here. See the
///   clean-room design audit §1.3 and the #1618 plan Amendment 4. The seam is
///   left deliberately open: do NOT generalize [`Self::coordinate`]'s `T` to
///   carry a stream — add the streaming entry point alongside it.
///   // #1631 layer 2 seam: add `coordinate_stream` here.
///
/// * **Layer 3 — cross-replica advisory-lock decorator (#1609).** The
///   leader-election decision (currently [`acquire_local_hydration`], driven
///   inside [`Self::coordinate`]) must be wrappable so a decorator can gate it
///   behind `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock(hash(repo_id‖path))`. Because election
///   is factored behind this trait, a decorator can implement `Coordinator` by
///   wrapping an inner `Coordinator`, taking the advisory lock around the inner
///   leader-election step, then delegating. No change to [`Self::coordinate`]'s
///   signature is required for that.
