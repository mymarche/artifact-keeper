/// * `max_severity` is about the findings on record, so it keys on whether

///   be completed".
///
/// #3142: `block_on_fail` used to key on a single `ORDER BY created_at DESC
/// LIMIT 1` across ALL `scan_type`s. With more than one engine enabled that is
/// a fail-open: scanner A crashes and writes `failed`, scanner B then finishes
/// clean, the global newest row reads `completed`, and `block_on_fail` never
/// fires. `classify_scan_state` is any-completed-wins, so `block_unscanned`
/// stays quiet too, and an artifact with a crashed scanner is served as fully
/// vetted with `block_on_fail` explicitly enabled. Keying per `scan_type` means
/// a later clean scan by a DIFFERENT engine can no longer mask engine A's
/// crash, while a genuine `completed` RESCAN by engine A itself still clears
/// it. Mirrors `scan_result_service::recalculate_score`'s `has_failed_scan`
/// window, which already had the right shape.
///
/// Both used to read the single newest row of any status, which made the
/// severity gate silently inert whenever the newest row was not `completed`.
/// Any scanner that records a non-terminal row (`pending`/`running`) or a
/// `not_applicable` row AFTER a completed one — an asynchronous or external
/// scanner does this routinely — therefore disabled severity blocking for that
/// artifact entirely, and a download with critical findings on record was
/// served with a 200. Keying on what is on record closes that fail-open.
///
/// Note the consequence for a `failed` newest row with `block_on_fail` off:
/// severity now still evaluates against the findings of the older completed
/// scan, where it previously skipped the check. That is the intended, strictly
/// safer direction — a crashed rescan must not clear an artifact's history.
///
/// `has_unacknowledged_findings` is the second half of that same argument.
/// Findings are persisted BEFORE the scan row is flipped to `completed`
/// (`scanner_service` calls `create_findings` and only then `complete_scan`),
/// so a scanner that dies in between — or is later reaped from `running` to
/// `failed` by the stuck-scan janitor — leaves unacknowledged findings on
/// record with NO completed row anywhere. Keying the gate on `completed`
/// alone would leave exactly the reported fail-open one layer down: an
/// unacknowledged critical on record, served 200. Grading whenever there is
