//! One-shot repair for Docker/OCI artifacts imported by earlier migration
//! runs (#2457).
//!
//! Before #2457 the migration worker stored Docker/OCI manifest and blob
//! bytes under generic CAS keys and inserted only `artifacts` rows — it
//! never registered anything in the OCI index (`oci_tags`, `oci_blobs`,
//! `oci_manifest_refs`, `manifest_blob_refs`). The V2 pull path resolves
//! exclusively through that index, so every migrated tag returned
//! `MANIFEST_UNKNOWN` even though the migration job reported success and
//! the UI/download API showed the artifacts.
//!
//! This module walks docker/oci `artifacts` rows whose paths look like
//! manifests but that have no matching `oci_tags` row, re-derives the
//! image/reference from the preserved source path, copies the manifest
//! bytes to the digest-addressed `oci-manifests/<digest>` key, registers
//! referenced blobs into `oci_blobs` (reusing each blob's existing CAS
//! `storage_key` — the blob-serve path honors arbitrary keys), and calls
//! the same `persist_tag_and_refs` the live push path uses.
//!
//! Additive-only: nothing is deleted or rewritten. Idempotent: after the
//! first successful pass the candidate query returns zero rows (each
//! repaired manifest now has its `oci_tags` row). Best-effort: a single
//! unreadable/malformed candidate is logged at WARN and skipped, never
//! failing startup. Spawned in the background from `main.rs` (next to the
//! `manifest_blob_refs` backfill) so it cannot delay the HTTP listener.
