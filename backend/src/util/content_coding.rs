//! Bounded stripping of an HTTP **content coding** from a buffered proxied
//! body, for the handlers that have to *parse* upstream bytes.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `http_client::base_client_builder` disables reqwest's transparent
//! decompression (`no_gzip`/`no_brotli`/`no_deflate`/`no_zstd`) so a proxied
//! `Content-Length` survives intact. The consequence is that every buffered
//! upstream body now arrives **still coded** whenever the upstream declared a
//! coding — and object stores (notably S3) return a *stored* `Content-Encoding`
//! regardless of what the request's `Accept-Encoding` advertised, so this is
//! reachable even though the shared client asks for `identity`.
//!
//! That splits proxy callers into two kinds, and they need opposite treatment:
//!
//! * a caller that forwards the buffered bytes **verbatim** must re-declare the
//!   upstream coding on its own response (#3149 / #3176 / #3184). It must NOT
//!   use this module — decoding on the client's behalf would also invalidate
//!   the `Content-Length` it copies from `bytes.len()`.
//! * a caller that **parses or transforms** the buffered bytes (a zip/tar
//!   walker, a JSON or index parser) sees compressed bytes where it expects the
//!   payload format, and fails. Forwarding a header does nothing for it; it has
//!   to decode *before* it parses. That is what this module is for (#3193).
//!
//! # Bounding
//!
//! The input is attacker-influenceable upstream data, so every decode runs
//! through [`bounded_archive::read_capped`] against the shared ingest
//! decompressed-byte budget ([`bounded_archive::max_ingest_decompressed_bytes`],
//! 128 MiB by default and env-tunable). A coded body that inflates past the
//! budget is rejected as a suspected decompression bomb rather than buffered.
//! Callers should additionally hold an ingest-extraction permit
//! ([`bounded_archive::with_ingest_extraction`]) around the decode + parse pair
//! so the CPU cost is admission-controlled like every other serve-time
//! extraction.
