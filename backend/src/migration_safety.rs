//! Online-migration safety gate (PF-008, #2524 — part of the million-artifact
//! perf epic #2516).
//!
//! At one million artifacts a migration that takes a table-level lock is an
//! outage, not a deploy step. The epic's "Online upgrades" release gate reads:
//! *large indexes and backfills have an online/concurrent runbook with
//! progress, throttling, retry and rollback; normal upload/download SLOs remain
//! within 2× baseline.* Nothing in the repository enforced that, so every new
//! migration was free to add another write-blocking statement to the upgrade
//! path and nobody would notice until an operator's uploads stalled.
//!
//! This module is that enforcement, in the same shape as the repository's other
//! invariant gates ([`crate::ci_test_surface`], `tests/streaming_invariant.rs`):
//! a text-level scan of `backend/migrations/*.sql` whose findings must match an
//! explicit allowlist exactly. New blocking DDL on a hot table fails the build;
//! an allowlist entry that no longer matches anything also fails, so the list
//! cannot silently rot.
//!
//! Like [`crate::ci_test_surface`] it lives in the LIBRARY rather than
//! `backend/tests/`, so `--lib` runs it unconditionally in both the unit-test
//! and coverage jobs and the gate cannot fall out of CI's `--test` allowlist.
//!
//! # What counts as blocking, and why
//!
//! The target is PostgreSQL 16/18 (`docker-compose.yml`, CI services), which
//! matters: several patterns that were rewrites on older servers are not any
//! more, and gating them would be noise.
//!
//! | Pattern | Lock taken | Effect on a hot table |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX` without `CONCURRENTLY` | `SHARE` | reads continue, **every write blocks** for the whole build |
//! | `ALTER TABLE … ADD CONSTRAINT` without `NOT VALID` | `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` | reads and writes block while every existing row is validated |
//! | `ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN … TYPE` | `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` | full table + index rewrite |
//! | `ALTER TABLE … ALTER COLUMN … SET NOT NULL` | `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` | full scan unless a validated `CHECK (col IS NOT NULL)` already exists |
//! | `ADD COLUMN … DEFAULT <volatile>` | `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` | full rewrite — a *non-volatile* default is catalog-only since PG 11 and is **not** gated |
//! | unbounded `UPDATE` / `DELETE` | row locks, one transaction | rewrites every matching row, doubles the heap, one WAL burst |
//! | `CLUSTER` / `VACUUM FULL` / `REINDEX` (non-concurrent) | `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` | rewrites the table |
//!
//! Note the first row. Three migrations already in history
//! (`106_artifacts_lower_name_index.sql`, `108_artifacts_filename_index.sql`,
//! `110_artifacts_repo_path_pattern_ops.sql`) describe their non-concurrent
//! index build as taking `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`. It is actually `SHARE`: concurrent
//! readers are fine, writers are not. Those files are history and must not be
//! edited, and the operational conclusion they draw — uploads stall for the
//! build duration — is correct either way.
//!
//! # The structural problem this gate exposes
//!
//! `sqlx::migrate!` runs each migration file inside a transaction unless the
//! file's **first bytes** are exactly `-- no-transaction` (sqlx 0.9,
//! `sqlx-core/src/migrate/source.rs`: `sql.starts_with("-- no-transaction")`).
//! `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is rejected inside a transaction block, so for
//! as long as no migration carries that header, *no* index in this repository
//! can be built online. That is why the allowlist below is 42 entries long: the
//! authors were not careless, the mechanism to do better was never wired up.
//!
//! Two further checks make that escape hatch usable rather than a new footgun:
//!
//! * `concurrent_ddl_requires_no_transaction_header` fails a migration that
//!   reaches for `CONCURRENTLY` without the header, which would otherwise blow
//!   up at runtime on the operator's database rather than in CI.
//! * `no_transaction_migrations_hold_one_statement` fails a `-- no-transaction`
//!   migration that contains more than one statement. sqlx runs a migration as
//!   `conn.execute(&sql)` with no bind parameters, which is the *simple* query
//!   protocol, and PostgreSQL puts a multi-statement simple query in an implicit
//!   transaction block. Verified against postgres:16-alpine:
//!
//!   ```text
//!   psql -c "CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY i ON t (v);"                 -> CREATE INDEX
//!   psql -c "DROP INDEX IF EXISTS i; CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ..." -> ERROR: CREATE INDEX
//!                                    CONCURRENTLY cannot run inside a transaction block
//!   psql -c "DO $$ BEGIN COMMIT; END $$;"                           -> DO
//!   psql -c "SELECT 1; DO $$ BEGIN COMMIT; END $$;"                 -> ERROR: invalid
//!                                                                      transaction termination
//!   ```
//!
//!   So `-- no-transaction` buys exactly one statement, and the `DROP INDEX IF
//!   EXISTS` that clears a leftover invalid index belongs in its own file.
//!
//! See `docs/operations/online-migrations.md` for the preflight/postflight
//! runbook a new online migration is expected to follow.
//!
//! # Deliberate limits
//!
//! * Only [`HOT_TABLES`] are gated. A blocking index on `system_settings` is
//!   not an outage and gating it would bury the signal in noise.
//! * A table created in the same migration file is skipped: it is empty, so
//!   indexing and constraining it is free.
//! * Dynamic DDL assembled with `format()` inside a single-quoted string
//!   (`125_repo_delete_fk_cascade.sql`, `200_users_fk_on_delete_actions.sql`)
//!   is masked away with the rest of the string literals and is NOT classified.
//!   Those two rebuild foreign keys across a table list computed at runtime;
//!   they need the runbook treatment, not a regex.
//! * `DO $$ … $$` bodies ARE scanned — a dollar-quoted block is executed SQL,
//!   and several migrations put their `ALTER TABLE` inside one.
