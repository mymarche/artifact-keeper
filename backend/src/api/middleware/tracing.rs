/// * **Trace-id spoofing.** A caller can join, or claim to join, an arbitrary

///   evidence — the same caveat [`CORRELATION_ID_MAX_BYTES`] already records
///   for correlation IDs, which are derived from this same header today.
/// * **Sampling.** The sampler is configurable (`OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER`, see
///   `SamplerChoice` in `crate::telemetry`). Under the default,
///   `parentbased_always_on`, every root span is sampled, so honouring a
///   remote parent can only *reduce* export volume (a caller sending
///   `sampled=00` suppresses its own trace). Under `parentbased_always_off`
///   or `parentbased_traceidratio`, however, an untrusted `sampled=01` forces
