//! Guest-access guard middleware (issue #850).
//!
//! Enforces a server-wide policy that disables anonymous (unauthenticated)
//! access. When `config.guest_access_enabled` is `false`, this middleware
//! returns `401 Unauthorized` for any request that does not present valid
//! credentials, with a small allowlist for endpoints that must remain
//! reachable so users and package clients can authenticate:
//!
//! * `/api/v1/auth/*`              login, refresh, logout, SSO callbacks
//! * `/api/v1/setup/*`             initial setup wizard
//! * `/api/v1/system/config`       web UI fetches before login
//! * `/health`, `/healthz`,
//!   `/ready`, `/readyz`, `/livez`  Kubernetes / load-balancer probes
//! * `/v2/token`                   OCI credential exchange (see below)
//!
//! **The OCI content surface is not exempt** (#3854). `/v2`, `/v2/` and every
//! manifest, blob, tag and referrer path are gated like any other
//! content-serving endpoint, so an anonymous `docker pull` of a `public`
//! repository is refused while the flag is off. The allowlist used to carry the
//! whole `/v2` subtree, but that was a response-*shape* workaround rather than a
//! policy carve-out: the guard's REST-shaped 401 names a bare realm that no
//! container client can fetch a token from. The refusal is now built by
//! [`oci_unauthorized_response`], which returns the distribution-spec error
//! envelope with a `Bearer` challenge naming this registry's token endpoint, so
//! the allowlist has nothing left to work around there.
//!
//! **`/v2/token` is the exception, and the guard cannot decide it.** The guard
//! resolves credentials from request headers. The token endpoint is where
//! credentials are *exchanged*, and one of the shapes reaching it — the OAuth2
//! refresh grant that every container client switches to after `docker login` —
//! carries its credential in the form body, where this layer cannot see it.
//! Gating the route therefore refuses authenticated pulls, not just anonymous
//! ones. The policy is applied inside `token()` instead, at the single exit that
//! hands a capability to a caller who presented none; every other credential the
//! endpoint accepts is authenticated there exactly as before.
//!
//! When `guest_access_enabled` is `true` (the default), the middleware is a
//! no-op so existing deployments are unaffected.
//!
//! ### Why we resolve auth ourselves
//!
//! The guard is registered as an outer (global) layer in `routes::create_router`,
//! which means it runs **before** the inner `auth_middleware` /
//! `optional_auth_middleware` / `repo_visibility_middleware` layers populate
//! request extensions. To make the gating decision we therefore resolve auth
//! directly and short-circuit if the path is not allowlisted. We resolve via
//! [`extract_visibility_token`] — the same channel-aware extractor the
//! repo-visibility middleware uses — so the guard honours every credential
//! channel the handlers accept, including the conda URL-embedded token and the
//! NuGet push `X-NuGet-ApiKey` header (not just the standard `Authorization` /
//! `X-API-Key` headers). Inner middlewares run again on requests that pass the
//! guard and populate the extensions used by handlers.
//!
//! We resolve via [`try_resolve_auth_outcome`] and match on the full
//! [`AuthOutcome`] rather than a boolean "is there a principal?" check, so a
//! transient [`AuthOutcome::Overloaded`] shed (the bcrypt-capacity cap
//! saturating) becomes a retryable **503**, not a 401. Flattening `Overloaded`
//! into an "unauthenticated" 401 would fail requests carrying valid credentials
//! under load — the exact regression `AuthOutcome::Overloaded` exists to prevent
//! (a saturated auth cap is retryable; non-retrying clients such as twine abort
//! on 401). The guard therefore returns the same 503 the inner middlewares do.
