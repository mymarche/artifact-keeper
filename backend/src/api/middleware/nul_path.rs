//! Reject a NUL byte anywhere in the decoded request path (#3622) or raw
//! query string (#3673).
//!
//! A percent-encoded `%00` in a URL path is decoded by axum's `Path`
//! extractor into a literal `\0` in the extracted `String`. Postgres rejects
//! that byte at the wire protocol (`invalid byte sequence for encoding
//! "UTF8": 0x00`), so any handler that forwards a path segment into a query
//! turned a trivially craftable anonymous request into a `500 DATABASE_ERROR`
//! — one pool checkout plus one failing query per request, and a coarse
//! implementation-detail leak. #3545 fixed the four generic repository-scoped
//! routes at their own path extraction; the same class still reached the
//! driver through the format-native wildcard routes (`/maven/{key}/*path`,
//! `/rpm/{key}/packages/*path`, `/hex/{key}/tarballs/*path`,
//! `/puppet/{key}/v3/files/*path`, `/ansible/{key}/download/*path`, …) and
//! through the repository **key** segment itself
//! (`/api/v1/repositories/pub%00gen/artifacts/a`).
//!
//! There are ~40 format handlers, so this is a single shared boundary rather
//! than a per-handler check: a global layer that inspects the decoded path
//! before routing and refuses the request with a 400. A NUL is not
//! representable in a stored artifact path (uploads reject it in
//! `upload_service::validate_artifact_path`) nor in a repository key, so no
//! request that could ever have succeeded is affected. Deliberately NUL-only
//! — every other byte a client may legitimately percent-encode still routes
//! exactly as before.
//!
//! #3673 extends the same boundary to the **raw query string**, which the path
//! check cannot see: `?name=a%00b` and `?format=a%00b` on
//! `/api/v1/search/advanced`, and `?prefix=a%00b` on `/api/v1/search/suggest`,
//! each decoded to a `\0` that `SearchService` binds verbatim, so every one of
//! them was the same anonymous `500 DATABASE_ERROR`. Guarding the raw query
//! here closes every **percent-encoded** query carrier at once — including
//! parameters added later — instead of the three named filters, and needs no
//! per-handler code.
//!
//! Two classes are outside this boundary by construction. The first is refused
//! at its own decoder; the second only where a field opts in:
//!
//! * A parameter that carries its own encoding. `?cursor=` on the artifact
//!   listing is base64 over JSON, so a `\u0000` inside it becomes a real `\0`
//!   with no percent-escape for the fast path to see;
//!   `handlers::repositories::decode_keyset_cursor` rejects it there.
//! * A JSON **body**, which is a stream — rejecting on it here would mean
//!   walking every request's bytes, binary uploads included. The one such site
//!   in #3673, `LoginRequest::username`, is refused at its own field with
//!   `extractors::deserialize_nul_free_string`; the remaining body fields are
//!   tracked in #3713.
//!
//! Unlike the path half, this is not free of behaviour change: a request
//! carrying a NUL anywhere in its query string is now refused, including on
//! parameters that previously tolerated it by stripping (`?q=` / `?query=`,
//! where `sanitize_tsquery_lexeme` dropped the byte and returned 200) and on
//! routes that never read the parameter at all (health probes, an unused
//! tracking parameter beside a working search). None of those could return
//! artifact content, and a NUL in a query string has no legitimate meaning on
//! any route, so refusing them is the intended trade rather than a side
//! effect.
