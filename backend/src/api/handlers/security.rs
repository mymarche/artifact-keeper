// to every artifact-keyed security read. This endpoint is the only surface that
// reports them, joined back to the calling repository's own cache catalog.
//
// Three properties are load-bearing and must not be relaxed:
//   1. Lookup is by cache PATH, never by digest. A digest parameter would make
//      this a cross-tenant lookup oracle (verdicts are shared by content hash
//      across every repository in the deployment); a path is inherently scoped
//      to the calling repository.
//   2. Authentication is required unconditionally, including on public
//      repositories -- `require_visible` returns early for `is_public`, so the
//      auth check MUST come first.
//   3. `repository_id` (the provenance column on `proxy_scan_results`) is never
//      returned, and `scanned_at` is floored at the caller's own `cached_at`:
//      a raw `scanned_at` predating the caller's first pull proves another
//      tenant fetched byte-identical content earlier, and when.

    // Regression: bypass_dedup must be admin-gated in trigger_scan.
    //
    // PR #1514 review feedback: `bypass_dedup` skips the hash-based scan
    // dedup short-circuit and fans out unbounded tokio::spawn workers across
    // an entire repository's artifacts. The pre-existing `force = true` path
    // was naturally rate-limited because dedup collapsed repeated calls
    // against the same checksum into a single cached result; `bypass_dedup`
    // removes that safety, so a non-admin caller setting it to true would be
    // a DoS amplifier.
    //
    // This test invokes the `trigger_scan` handler directly (not via the
    // router) so it covers the actual 403 branch under `cargo llvm-cov`.
    // It runs against a real Postgres pool when `DATABASE_URL` is set and
    // no-ops cleanly otherwise, matching the `tdh::Fixture` pattern used
    // by sibling handler tests.
    //
    // #2321 G5 update: the handler is now admin-only for EVERY request shape
    // (not just bypass_dedup=true), so a non-admin can no longer trigger scans
    // at all — closing the amplification lever on the default/false shapes too.
    //
    // Coverage strategy: four call shapes prove the gate's behaviour without
    // spinning up a real scan run:
    //
    //   1. non-admin + bypass_dedup=true    -> 403 Authorization (the gate)
    //   2. non-admin + bypass_dedup omitted -> 403 Authorization (all shapes)
    //   3. non-admin + bypass_dedup=false   -> 403 Authorization
    //   4. admin     + no ids               -> 400 Validation
    //      (admins pass the gate and land on the next check; not over-blocked)
