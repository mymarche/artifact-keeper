//! VS Code Extensions (VSIX Marketplace) API handlers.
//!
//! Implements a VS Code Marketplace-compatible API for extension hosting.
//!
//! Routes are mounted at `/vscode/{repo_key}/...`:
//!   GET  /vscode/{repo_key}/api/extensionquery                              - Query extensions
//!   GET  /vscode/{repo_key}/extensions/{publisher}/{name}/{version}/download - Download VSIX
//!   POST /vscode/{repo_key}/api/extensions                                  - Publish extension
//!   GET  /vscode/{repo_key}/api/extensions/{publisher}/{name}/latest         - Latest version info
//!
//! The `/gallery/...` routes are an Open VSX gateway for public Remote
//! repositories. They intentionally coexist with the legacy routes above:
//! hosted VSIX publishing and its existing clients continue using the legacy
//! surface.
