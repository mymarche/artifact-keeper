//!
//! The discovery endpoints are required by the `ansible-galaxy` CLI: before
//! any other call it performs `GET <server_url>/api` to negotiate which
//! Galaxy API version to use. Without it the CLI aborts with
//! `Error when finding available api versions (HTTP Code: 404, Message: Not Found)`.
//!
//! Note the discovery URL has NO trailing slash on the wire: ansible-core's
//! `g_connect` builds it as `_urljoin(n_url, '/api/')` and `_urljoin` strips
//! `/` from every component (`lib/ansible/galaxy/api.py`), so the client
//! requests `<server_url>/api`. All later v3 URLs get an explicit `+ '/'`,
//! which is why only the discovery route needs both spellings (#3137).
//!
//! # The Galaxy v3 publish contract (#3282)
//!
//! `ansible-galaxy collection publish` is a two-call sequence, not one upload.
//! `GalaxyAPI.publish_collection` (`lib/ansible/galaxy/api.py`) ends with a
//! *hard index* into the upload response — `return resp['task']` on
//! `stable-2.17` through `stable-2.19`, and `return urljoin(self.api_server,
//! resp['task'])` on `devel`. A response without a `task` key therefore kills
//! the CLI with `ERROR! Unexpected Exception, this is probably a bug: 'task'`
//! before `--no-wait` is ever consulted: `wait` is read one frame upstream, in
//! `lib/ansible/galaxy/collection/__init__.py::publish_collection`.
//!
//! The client then polls that task. **Emitting `task` without also serving the
//! import-status route converts the crash into an indefinite hang**, because
//! `wait_import_task` treats 404 as "the import has not started yet" and
//! retries, and the CLI defaults are `--import-timeout` `default=0` (never time
//! out) with `--no-wait` `dest='wait', action='store_false', default=True`
//! (wait by default). The route and the field have to land together.
//!
//! ## Why the emitted `task` is a root-absolute path
//!
//! One spelling has to satisfy both client generations, and they consume the
//! value differently:
//!
//! * `stable-2.17`..`stable-2.19`: the caller in `collection/__init__.py`
//!   reduces the value to its **last non-empty path segment**
//!   (`for path_segment in reversed(import_uri.split('/'))`) and
//!   `wait_import_task(task_id)` rebuilds the URL as
//!   `_urljoin(api_server, 'v3/', 'imports/collections', task_id, '/')`.
//!   Since `g_connect` has already rewritten `self.api_server` to the URL that
//!   served `available_versions` (`self.api_server = n_url`), that is
//!   `/ansible/{repo_key}/api/v3/imports/collections/{task_id}/`.
//! * `stable-2.20` and `devel`: `urljoin(self.api_server, resp['task'])` is passed to
//!   `wait_import_task` **verbatim**, with no segment extraction. A
//!   root-absolute reference resolves against the origin, yielding the same
//!   URL.
//!
//! So a root-absolute path ending in `/{task_id}/` is correct for both — and it
//! is the shape ansible-core itself documents as the v3 reference response:
//! `{"task": "/api/automation-hub/v3/imports/collections/838d1308-...-7823f3806cd8/"}`.
//! A bare id would break `stable-2.20` and `devel` (relative resolution drops the last segment of
//! `api_server`); a full path would break the stable line only if the stable
//! line used it verbatim, which it does not.
//!
//! ## The document is synthetic, and honestly so
//!
//! Artifact Keeper has no asynchronous import pipeline: `upload_collection`
//! validates, stores, and inserts the artifact row inline, so by the time the
//! `202` is written the "import" is already finished. The status route
//! therefore reports a completed import derived from the stored artifact rather
//! than from a job queue. It reports no progress because there is no progress
//! to report; a validation failure never reaches this route at all, because it
//! is returned as a `4xx` from the upload itself and `_call_galaxy` raises on
//! any non-2xx.
