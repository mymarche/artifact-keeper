//! Helm Chart Repository API handlers.
//!
//! Implements the endpoints required for `helm repo add`, `helm install`,
//! and ChartMuseum-compatible upload/delete.
//!
//! Routes are mounted at `/helm/{repo_key}/...`:
//!   GET    /helm/{repo_key}/index.yaml                        - Repository index
//!   GET    /helm/{repo_key}/charts/{name}-{version}.tgz       - Download chart package
//!   GET    /helm/{repo_key}/charts/{name}-{version}.tgz.prov  - Download chart provenance
//!   POST   /helm/{repo_key}/api/charts                        - Upload chart (multipart)
//!   DELETE /helm/{repo_key}/api/charts/{name}/{version}        - Delete chart
//!
//! ## Provenance (#2635)
//!
//! `helm package --sign` emits a clearsigned `<chart>.tgz.prov` next to the
//! chart. The client does **not** discover it from `index.yaml` — the helm
//! index schema has no provenance field. Instead `helm pull --verify` takes the
//! chart URL it resolved from `index.yaml` and string-appends `.prov`
//! (verified against helm 3.16.4). So provenance is served by the *existing*
//! `charts/{filename}` route: the upload stores the prov under the chart's
//! filename + `.prov`, and the download route resolves it by the same
//! suffix lookup the chart itself uses.

    // With that file absent it dies with
    //   Error: failed to fetch provenance ".../<chart>-<version>.tgz.prov"
    // and with it present at exactly that path (index.yaml unchanged) it prints
    // "Chart Hash Verified: sha256:...". The helm index schema has no
    // provenance field, so serving that path IS the advertised layout.
