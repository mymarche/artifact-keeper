//! Package analysis: what is actually *inside* an artifact.
//!
//! Serves the ingest-time analysis recorded by migration 221 — the native
//! libraries a conda package vendors, the install-time scripts it carries, and
//! crucially whether we managed to read the package at all (#4033).
//!
//! # Why `completeness` is not an afterthought
//!
//! Every other field here is a *finding*. `completeness` is the statement of
//! how much weight a reader may put on the absence of findings. An empty
//! `vendored_components` list means "this package vendors nothing" when the
//! status is `complete`, and means "we never opened the archive" when it is
//! `not_read` — and conflating those is the exact defect #4035/#4036 exist to
//! remove. The schema makes the distinction unforgeable (`status` is NOT NULL
//! with no default, and a CHECK requires `reason` whenever it is not
//! `complete`); this module's job is to carry it to the client without
//! flattening it.
//!
//! So: no `#[serde(default)]` on `status`, no `unwrap_or("complete")`, and no
//! "helpful" omission of the field when everything looks fine. A client that
//! cannot see the status must not be able to infer a clean bill of health.
