//! Health check endpoints.
//!
//! Provides Kubernetes-style probes:
//! - `/livez`   - lightweight liveness (process alive, no external deps)
//! - `/readyz`  - readiness gate (DB + migrations reachable). Initial-setup
//!   state (admin password change required) is reported as an informational
//!   field but does NOT cause a 503. A 503 here would make Kubernetes restart
//!   the pod and prevent operators from completing setup via `kubectl exec`.
//! - `/health`  - rich status page for dashboards (all services + pool stats)
//! - `/healthz` - alias for `/health`
//!
//! All four are registered at the router root (`api::routes`), outside the
//! `/api/v1` nest, so they are unauthenticated and no `rate_limit_*` layer
//! applies. That is deliberate: orchestrators, load balancers and dashboards
//! poll these constantly, and throttling or authenticating them turns a
//! dependency hiccup into a self-inflicted outage (a 429'd or 401'd liveness
//! probe reads as "dead" to Kubernetes). The cost of an anonymous request is
//! bounded at the work instead — every dependency sub-check on `/health` runs
//! behind a short-TTL, single-flight cache, so an arbitrary request rate
//! collapses to one probe per dependency per window (#3127).
