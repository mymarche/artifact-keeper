// A CI test-shard build (`--features test-shard-<name>`, see
// scripts/ci/test-shards.py) compiles only that shard's inline test modules,
// so `#[cfg(test)]` helpers and imports shared between shards are
// legitimately unused in some of them, and a helper module such as
// `scanner_service::test_helpers` can end up looking like a misplaced last
// test module to `clippy::items_after_test_module`. Relax exactly those
// lints, and only in that build: the ordinary build compiles every test
// module and keeps all three (Check Rust's clippy runs it with `-D warnings`).
