///   under `proxy-cache-staging/` — written at the bucket root (#1555).

/// hold*: a `StorageRole::ProxyCache` handle forced the prefix off while a
/// `StorageRole::ArtifactSource` handle kept it. Every reader of a proxy-cache

/// deployment those reads missed every time while the object sat untouched at
/// the root (#3368), and the miss-recovery write-back then deposited a second,
/// permanently unread copy under the prefix.
