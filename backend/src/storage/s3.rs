//! S3 storage backend using the `object_store` crate (Apache Arrow project).
//!
//! Supports AWS S3 and S3-compatible services (MinIO, Ceph RGW, R2, Huawei OBS, etc.).
//! Configuration via environment variables:
//! - S3_BUCKET: Bucket name (required)
//! - S3_REGION: AWS region (default: us-east-1)
//! - S3_ENDPOINT: Custom endpoint URL for S3-compatible services
//! - S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Access key (preferred, falls back to AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)
//! - S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Secret key (preferred, falls back to AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
//!
//! For TLS configuration:
//! - S3_CA_CERT_PATH: Path to PEM file with custom CA certificate(s)
//! - S3_INSECURE_TLS: Disable TLS certificate verification (default: false)
//!
//! For S3-compatible providers:
//! - S3_DISABLE_MULTI_DELETE: Use single-object DELETE instead of multi-object
//!   POST ?delete (default: false). Required for providers that do not implement
//!   the S3 DeleteObjects API, such as Huawei Cloud OBS.
//! - S3_PROVIDER: Pin the provider dialect instead of inferring it from
//!   S3_ENDPOINT. `oss` (aliases `aliyun`, `alibaba`) selects the Alibaba Cloud
//!   OSS dialect, which copies objects with a streaming PUT because OSS ignores
//!   `x-amz-copy-source` (#3594); `aws` (alias `generic`) forces the plain S3
//!   dialect. Unset infers OSS from an `*.aliyuncs.com` endpoint.
//!
//! For HTTP connection pool tuning:
//! - S3_POOL_MAX_IDLE_PER_HOST: Maximum idle connections per host (default: 256)
//! - S3_POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS: Idle connection timeout in seconds (default: 90)
//!
//! For HTTP request timeouts:
//! - S3_BULK_TIMEOUT_SECS: Overall request timeout for bulk data transfer --
//!   object payload reads/writes, multipart part uploads, and server-side
//!   CopyObject (default: 1800). Control-plane calls (head/list/delete/exists)
//!   keep a short [`S3_CONTROL_TIMEOUT`] so a wedged endpoint still fails fast.
//!   Set to 0 to disable the bulk timeout entirely.
//! - S3_MAX_SINGLE_COPY_BYTES: Largest object copied with one server-side
//!   CopyObject (default: 5 GiB, AWS's cap). Larger sources are copied via
//!   multipart UploadPartCopy in slices of this size. Clamped into
//!   [5 MiB, 5 GiB]. Lever for S3-compatible stores with lower copy limits.
//!
//! For redirect downloads (302 to presigned URLs):
//! - S3_REDIRECT_DOWNLOADS: Enable 302 redirects (default: false)
//! - S3_PRESIGN_EXPIRY_SECS: URL expiry in seconds (default: 3600)
//!
//! For CloudFront CDN:
//! - CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_URL: CloudFront distribution URL (optional)
//! - CLOUDFRONT_KEY_PAIR_ID: CloudFront key pair ID for signing
//! - CLOUDFRONT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH: Path to CloudFront private key PEM file
//!
//! For Artifactory migration:
//! - STORAGE_PATH_FORMAT: Storage path format (default: native)
//!   - "native": 2-level sharding {sha[0:2]}/{sha[2:4]}/{sha}
//!   - "artifactory": 1-level sharding {sha[0:2]}/{sha} (JFrog Artifactory format)
//!   - "migration": Write native, read from both (for zero-downtime migration)
